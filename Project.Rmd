## Introduction

Data science and analytics has become more prevalent and has increased rapidly in the past decade. With this increase sports analytics is playing a more crucial role in the sports industry. Professional leagues such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) have utilized on court analytics to increase player and team performance, while management utilizes off-field analytics to get a better understanding or insight of the business side of their franchise. As a direct indicator of ticket sales, attendance is an important area to study. Many factors affect attendance, but the influence of each factor is different. The purpose of this research project is to determine the team rating a team require to guarantee a 1% home game attendance increase of 179 people per season. 
Information from my project will be helpful for the NBA owners and other professional and semiprofessional leagues. The clients that this project will deal with will begin with NBA sport teams then towards other leagues such as football and etc. Clients will be interested in this project because of how the potential increase in value can attract larger big ticket players to their organization.  The data information involved in the project includes the 2018-2019 NBA teams home game attendance data, the 1% increase of the home game attendance, the percent of attendance increase, the team rating, and the net rating (NRTG). The approach that will be taken in regards of solving the problem is after analyzing all the data gathered and then data wrangling it. We then created the best linear regression model to predict the most effective team rating required for teams to pass that 1% attendance increase threshold. The deliverables of the project will be presented on a blog summarizing everything that the project contains.
The goal of this project is to determine the required team rating required for a 1% increase in team attendance.
  
NBA.team - the person that taught the class
2018-2019 season home game attendance - the home game attendance from the 2018-2019 season that the data comes from. 
1 percent increase of attendance - the 1% increase of the 2018-2019 season home game attendance
Difference - the difference from the the 1 percent increase and the original attendance data.
Percentage Increase - displays the percentage amount that the attendance increased by from 1% increase
NRTG  - teams net rating which are made up from their offensive and defensive rating from the 2018-2019 season.
Team.Rating - the teams rating is made up of the highest player efficiency rating (PER) on that team.
Increase - displays the teams that did or did not pass the 179 average people threshold after the 1% attendance increase

The necessary libraries needed for the project has been installed and are loaded here.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rmarkdown)
```
All of the packages are loaded.  Therefore, we load the data into R and call the data frame attendance.

```{r}
cleannew <- read.csv("teamAttendance5.csv")
glimpse(cleannew)
```
```{r}
#Removing columns from the dataframe 
cleannew$X <- NULL 
cleannew$X.1 <- NULL
cleannew$Teams.Operating.Income <- NULL
cleannew$metro.area.population <- NULL
cleannew$X2018.2019.season.Road.Game.Attendance <- NULL
cleannew$Teams.Roster.Salary <- NULL
cleannew$star.expenses <- NULL
#creating column to show teams that met/did not meet the guarentee increase rate. 
cleannew$Increase<- ifelse(cleannew$Teams.Revenue >= 169.99,1,0)
#Renaming data frame variables
colnames(cleannew)[colnames(cleannew)=="Teams.Revenue"] <- "Difference"
colnames(cleannew)[colnames(cleannew)=="win.to.player.cost.ratio.increase"] <- "Percentage increase"
colnames(cleannew)[colnames(cleannew)=="Teams.location.median.income"] <- "1 percent increase of attendance"
glimpse(cleannew)
str(cleannew)
```
## Data Wrangligling

The dataset was provided with nearly all the complete information needed. However, a couple of data wrangling techniques are to be used to achieve a clean data set. As you can see there are 30 observations (rows) and 8 variables in our dataset. All of the variables are very self-explanatory but there are a couple variables that need to be renamed, deleted, and added another variable to display 1 for the teams that have the capacity to increase attendance by an average of 1%, which is 179 fans and 0 for otherwise.   
We can easily manipulate the data to fit our needs by utilizing the tidyverse package.  

We can also view the data as a scatter plot.  
```{r}
ggplot(cleannew,aes(y = NBA.team, x = Difference , color=Increase)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("2019 NBA Team Attendance Increase")
```
## Statistical Analyis 
 
The x-axis contained the NBA teams while the y-axis contained the 1% increase. 
With this graph you can see that the majority of the league's teams have the capacity to increase attendance by an average of 1%, which is 179 fans. The number 179 originated from multiplying the attendance by 1% and then subtracting the attendance from the 1% and then taking the average of all of the differences the number 179 was created. 
```{r}
ggplot(cleannew, aes(y = NBA.team, x =Team.Rating , color=NRTG)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("2019 NBA Team Ratings")
```
This graph shows a correlation between the net rating and team rating of all the teams. In the graph you notice that the teams who have a team rating greater than 21 have a net rating (NRTG) greater than 0. After observing both scatter plots another finding can be made. The teams with a team rating greater than 21 also are the same teams who have the capacity to achieve an attendance increase greater than or equal to 179 fans.
```{r}
```
## Machine Learning - linear Regression

The data has been collected, cleaned, and wrangled into shape and explored it. Due to the dependent variable being numerical, the basis of the machine learning would be creating a linear regression. Team rating is the dependent variable and We used the rest of the variables as independent variables to view how total Team rating is changed. Then we proceeded to use the training data set to create our model that will find the significance levels of the different variables in our data.  

```{r}
validation_index <- createDataPartition(cleannew$Team.Rating, p=0.80, list=FALSE)
validation <- cleannew[-validation_index,]
Adata <- cleannew[validation_index,]
```
In our machine learning we split our data into two different sets to get our validation results. We then split it into a training dataset which is 80% of our data and a testing dataset which is 20%. 
```{r}
model = lm( Team.Rating ~ NRTG, data= Adata)

summary(model)
```
The model shows that NRTG is a significant variable to predict the team rating.The p value is .003276. A P value less than .05 results in a higher significance and a better model.The multiple R squared is .4222. The closer the mulitple R-squared value is to 1 the better the model is. Therefore the NRTG model could be better. and a significance code of three stars. The root mean squred variable (RMSE) variable shows how close the independent varible is to the line of best fit,it can range from 0 to any number. In our case the smaller the number compared to the average team rating the better the model, our model is good enough but it could be better with a RMSE value is 2.719768. Finally, the significance code which is represented by stars shows how significant an independent variable is to the dependent variable, three stars showing very significant and no stars showing no significance. The NRTG model had a three star significance level which again validates the signifance of the variable towards the dependent variable. 
```{r}
```
A very important question when creating a model and exploring various feature combinations is aqraccy.In order to measure accuracy, we use cross validation.The training data set gets split into 5 parts randomly. The code below iterate 1 to 5 times.
```{r}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5)
set.seed(7)
fit <- train(Team.Rating ~ NRTG,data=Adata, method="lm", metric="RMSE", trControl=control)
print(fit)
```
The cross validation shows acurcy because the rmse and r sqaured are nearly the same as those in our model 1. To check addtional accracy we will run the model on validation set.seed
```{r}
```

## Results
The results from our cross validation set displayed the root mean squared (RMSE) and R^2 value and how both are significant to our predictions. The RMSE shows how close the independent variable is to the line of best fit, it can range from 0 to any number. The smaller the number the better the model. The NRTG model has a RMSE value of 2.178893 and due to how close our number is to 0 our model is good enough. Then another determinant of selecting the best model is the R squared value. The R squared value determines how “close” the points are to the regression line. The values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating that the data points are “closer” and more tightly correlated to the regression line. The closer the R squared is to 1 the better the model is, our R squared value is .6116956 therefore again validating the significance of the variable towards the dependent variable. 
```{r}
```

## Machine Learning Model
$$y=23.3426x_1+.4273x_2$$
```{r}
```
## Recommendations
1. Try to use another intervention
2. Collect additional data on the variables that can influence team rating.
3. Higher me fulltime
```{r}
```


## Future Work
In our future works we will create a program to merge data from various data sets to find more significant independent variables that can attribute to a better model that will influence the results for my dependent variable more significantly.
